# EV Threat Detection ðŸš—âš¡ðŸ”’

A machine learningâ€“powered system to detect potential cyber-attacks on Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations from incoming communication logs â€” now with **custom sound alerts** for each type of attack.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Electric Vehicle charging stations are increasingly network-connected, making them susceptible to threats such as **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)**, **Spoofing**, and **DoS** attacks.  
This project uses a trained machine learning model to classify logs as **Normal** or **Attack** in real time.

The included `detect.py` script:
- Reads incoming CSV logs (no label required)
- Extracts and prepares features
- Classifies each row
- **Plays unique audio alerts** for each attack type
- Shows probability scores for transparency
